          and Ireland, available as a standard retail account for all traders.

          Spread betting and CFDs are derivative products that allow you to
          speculate on the price movements of financial assets without taking
          ownership. The main difference between the two accounts is how they
          are taxed. Learn more about each product in our{" "}
