          Trading derivatives on shares differs from the traditional investment
          approach of buying and owning shares. One difference is that you can
          utilise leverage, which means you only need to put up a percentage of
          the full value of the trade. This means any profit or loss you make is
          magnified, relative to a share&apos;s price fluctuations. Read more
