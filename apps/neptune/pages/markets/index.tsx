        <p>
          Financial markets is a very broad term and can vary from world to
          virtual currencies, commodities to stock indices, shares to ETFs plus
          rates and bonds, where traders can invest in or trade on a huge range
          of securities and derivatives.

      question: "What is leveraged trading?",
      answer: (
        <>
          One of the advantages of spread betting and trading CFDs is that you
          only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of your position
          to open a trade, known as&nbsp;

      question: "What are indices?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Indices are a measure of a section of shares in the stock market,
          created by combining the value of several stocks to create one
          aggregate value. Major financial indices include the Dow Jones
          Industrial Average, FTSE 100, CAC 40, and Dax 40. The Dow Jones index,
          for example, represents 30 large publicly-listed companies traded on
          the New York Stock Exchange.&nbsp;

      answer: (
        <>
          FX trading, also known as foreign exchange trading, or forex trading,
          is the exchange of different currencies on a decentralised global
          market. It&apos;s one of the largest and most liquid financial markets
          in the world. Forex trading involves the simultaneous buying and
          selling of the world&apos;s currencies on this market.&nbsp;

      question: "What is a commodity?",
      answer: (
        <>
          A commodity is a physical good that can be bought or sold on the
          commodity market. Commodities can be categorised into either hard or
          soft varieties. Hard commodities are natural resources like oil, gold
          and rubber and are often mined or extracted. Soft commodities are
          agricultural products such as coffee, wheat or corn.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Share trading in the underlying market is the buying and selling of
          company shares with the aim of making a profit. Shares represent a
          portion of ownership of a public company.&nbsp;

          A bond is a fixed-income instrument, or debt security, and represents
          a long-term lending agreement between a borrower and lender â€“
          effectively an &apos;IOU&apos;. The bond issuer is often a corporation
          or a government, and the funds are used to finance a project or
          operation.&nbsp;
