          <>
            FX Active is an account designed for high-volume traders, who want
            to get even more from their forex trading. It features tighter
            spreads and fixed commissions, enabling pure price transparency. In
            addition to over 330 FX pairs on our proprietary platform, or over
            175 through the MT4 platform, all other non-FX instruments are also
            available to trade in the same way as with a standard account.

        question:
          "Which currency pairs are available with an FX Active account?",
        answer: (
          <>
            On our trading platform, there are more than 330 forex instruments
            to trade, while on MT4 you can trade on over 170 FX pairs with us.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "Which markets can I trade on with an FX Active account?",
        answer: (
          <>
            With an FX Active account, you can trade on all the markets and
            instruments available on our standard CFD platform. So, on our own
            platform, you can trade on FX, indices, commodities, shares, ETFs,
            share baskets, forex indices, plus rates and bonds. On MT4, you can
            trade on FX, indices and commodities. Note that only certain FX
            instruments have spreads from 0.0 pips.

      },
      {
        question: "What are the costs associated with an FX Active account?",
        answer: (
          <>
            FX Active has fully transparent commissions across all forex pairs
            at 0.0025% per transaction, as well as minimum spreads from 0.0 pips
            on six major FX pairs, and a 25% spread reduction compared with our
            standard CFD account on all the other currency pairs we offer.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: "How does the commission work with FX Active?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Commission is charged at a fixed rate of 0.0025% per transaction.
            This works out as $2.50 per $100,000 worth of currency trade. At
            this notional volume, it would cost $5 to open and close a trade.
            MT4 commissions are charged upfront for opening and closing trades.

        question: "What is an FX Active demo account?",

            An FX Active demo account allows you to experience the
            platform&apos;s wide range of innovative features and tools in a
            risk-free environment. You can practise trading on your favourite

      {
        question: "Do demo accounts expire?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Our own platform demo account remains open once created. MT4
            platform demo accounts remain active provided that you log in to the
            platform at least once every 30 days. If you don&apos;t log in
            within that timeframe, your demo account will automatically be
            closed. You can set up a new account again at any time in the
            future.
