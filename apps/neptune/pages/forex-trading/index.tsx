      question: "What is online forex trading?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          FX trading, also known as foreign exchange trading, or forex trading,
          is the exchange of different currencies on a decentralised global
          market. It&apos;s one of the largest and most liquid financial markets
          in the world. Forex trading involves the simultaneous buying and
          selling of the world&apos;s currencies on this market.&nbsp;
          <a href="/en-gb/learn-forex/what-is-forex">
            What is forex trading and how does it work?

      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How to trade on forex?",
      answer: (
        <>
          When trading forex, you speculate on whether the price of one currency
          will rise or fall against another. For example, if you believe that
          the value of the British pound will rise, relative to the value of the
          US dollar, you would trade the GBP/USD pair.{" "}

      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How does forex trading work?",

    },
    {
      question: "What is margin in forex?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Forex margin rates are usually expressed as a percentage, with forex
          margin requirements typically starting at around 3.3% in the UK for
          major foreign exchange currency pairs. Your FX broker&apos;s margin
          requirement shows you the leverage you can use when trading forex with
          that broker.{" "}

      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What is leveraged trading?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          One of the advantages of spread betting and trading CFDs is that you
          only need to deposit a percentage of the full value of your position
          to open a trade, known as trading on leverage. Remember,{" "}

            trading on leverage
