              You can add a guaranteed stop-loss order (GSLO) to your trade for
              a premium, which guarantees to close you out at your specified
              level, regardless of market volatility or gapping. If the GSLO is
              not triggered, we&apos;ll refund 100% of the original GSLO charge.
              The charge, or &apos;premium&apos;, is calculated by multiplying
              the premium rate by the bet size.

              There&apos;s a monthly charge of Â£10 (the amount depends on your
              account currency) on dormant accounts, but no deduction is made if
              there are no funds in the account. An account is considered
              dormant if there has been no trading activity for a continuous
              period of one year.
